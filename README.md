# Kinect2DLL


A QT C DLL that hooks into Kinect20.lib



This is useful for languages such as Delphi to access the Kinect2 device under windows.



Only the depth stream is exposed in this DLL, but I do have another DLL that hasn't been released that accesses the color camera, IR camera, and body data.
